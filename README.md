[Documentation](http://vosen.github.io/toml_document/toml_document)

This library provides a document-style interface to
[TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) files. Document-style for this library
means supporting edit operations that preserve markup of the file. E.g. you can
edit a value without losing comments and formatting.
